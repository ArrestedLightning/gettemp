With the Linux thermometer project our goal is to measure the local temperature 
with own made hardware (based on the Dallas 1621 sensor), and connect that 
hardware to a Linux box to create graphs.

The GetTemp program is able to read the temperature of (maximum 8) dallas 1621 
temperature sensors with Linux. Before you can measure the local temperature you 
have to build the thermometer hardware and plug it on any available rs232 serial 
port. More information about the Linux thermometer project and howto build the 
thermometer harware look at http://www.joepverhaeg.nl/linuxtp.html

As the base for this project we used the Dallas 1621 sensor information on the 
website of Alberto Ricci Bitti. He wrote software in Visual Basic 5 for reading 
the current temperature from the sensor(s). Full source code and binaries for 
Microsoft® Windows 9x/2K/XP are available on his page: 
http://www.riccibitti.com/pc_therm.htm.

The software comes with ABSOLUTLY NO WARRANTY. This is free software, please 
feel free to distribute it under te GPL conditions (for more information see 
gnu.org). If you like the software you can send a postcard to the address below. 
I would appreciate that very much (and local scenery is my favorite)!
